# 🧮 JavaScript Mini Project – **Simple Calculator**

After building a strong foundation in layout design with **HTML and CSS**, I moved into **JavaScript** to explore interactivity and logic. This **Simple Calculator** is a mini project that helped me understand core JavaScript concepts, especially how to interact with the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 (Semantic Markup)
- CSS3 (UI Styling & Layout)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Functional Logic)

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and interactive user interface  
- Live input display using the **DOM**  
- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - ➕ Addition
  - ➖ Subtraction
  - ✖️ Multiplication
  - ➗ Division  
- Additional functionalities:
  - **C (Clear)** button to reset input
  - **Del (Delete)** button to remove the last character
  - **Decimal support**  
- Button hover effects using CSS  
- Lightweight and responsive layout

## 📚 Key Concepts Learned

- 📌 **DOM Manipulation** using `document.getElementById()`  
- 📌 Creating reusable functions like `show()`, `cal()`, `clearDisplay()`, and `del()`  
- 📌 Using `eval()` to process string expressions (and understanding its limitations)  
- 📌 Working with **onclick events** to trigger JavaScript functions  
- 📌 Structuring code with readable, maintainable logic  
- 📌 Designing components with **CSS positioning and spacing**

## 💡 Goal

The goal of this project was to understand **how JavaScript communicates with HTML via the DOM**, allowing me to build functional and interactive web elements. This is a key stepping stone in my **full stack development journey**.
